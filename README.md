# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information and Technology and have experience as a Software Engineer, where I specialized in developing cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter. My work primarily focused on IoT projects, involving seamless communication between mobile apps and devices such as EV chargers and batteries. Currently, I am pursuing my M.Tech in Robotics and AI at IIT Guwahati, where I am expanding my expertise into cutting-edge technologies and advanced robotics systems.
